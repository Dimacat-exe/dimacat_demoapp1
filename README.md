# dimacat_playground2
- This is my first attempt to deploy an app on streamlit
- Current stage: Beta-ish -> Beta
- Model use to train: YOLOv8 -> Yolov10
- What works:
  + Detect a lot of cats
  + Can detect many images in consecutive
  + Video mode move to beta-ish stage now
  + Video mode randomly works, just like you are playing Russian Roulette
- What not works:
  + The video detection still buggy and need more fix
  + Sometimes the process can be sluggish
  + Need better enhancement as some cats are undetected
  + The second pretrain seems to be less accuracy than the first one
